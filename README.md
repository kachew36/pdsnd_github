### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Python Project

### Description
This project explores US Bikeshare data using Python code to create an _interactive_ way to analyze data from 3 US Cities:

- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington

It allows the user to filter data by **city**, **month**, and **day of the week**.

The data displayed includes statistics on:

- The most frequent times of travel broken down by month, day of week, and start hour
- The most popular stations and trip
- The total and average trip duration
- Bikeshare users (when provided by the city) based on:
    - user types
    - gender
    - year of birth

There is also an option to view raw data 5 lines at a time if desired by the user and restart the code at the end.
